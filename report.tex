    \section{Overview}

    This report sets provides the solutions to the two indidivual
    ciphers set for the ELEC6242 Coursework challenge, as well as
    detailing the process which was used to crack these.

    \section{Cipher 1}

    \begin{displayquote}
        The findings could lead to a better understanding of black hole
        mergers and galaxy evolution, and also help shed light on a
        long-standing conundrum in astrophysics called the "final
        parsec problem." That refers to the failure of theoretical
        models to predict what the final stages of a black hole merger
        look like, or even how long the process might take.
